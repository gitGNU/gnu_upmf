The package files need be integrated in Upmf's package tree. A tree might
look like this:

./builds  --> Where the build process is done
./dest    --> Where packages get installed into
./dist    --> Where archive files are saved
./files   --> Where the package files are stored

The last directory is where you want to save the package files.  Either
copy the files from this directory or better, do a git clone.  The latter
makes it easy to keep up to date with the progress made upstream and is
recommended.
